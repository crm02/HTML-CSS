             <!--To make something happen when the user clicks the submit button, such as take the info
            entered above and sticking it into a database, you need to write a script to handle the
            submit clicked action. The script itself is out of the scope of this tutorial, but lets say it
            was myaction.php. Then we would modify the opening form tag to have the form execute
            this action when the button is clicked:
            <form action=“myaction.php”>-->
        </form>
